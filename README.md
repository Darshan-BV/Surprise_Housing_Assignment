## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

We have used train.csv which contain the data provided by Surprise Housing agency for this assignment 



## Conclusions

In our model Lasso Regression performs better then Ridge and Linear Regression with R2 value of  89% on Test Data
